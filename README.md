As i started educating my self using the free courses on Khan Academy, i reach programing and i started as i learned,
developing a mimic of the structure course menu from the web site of Khan Academy were i write small programs in cpp
to try to solve the problems were given by the courses.
This is the link to the web site of Khan Academy: https://www.khanacademy.org

The project becomes more complex as i reach more difficult task and requiers constant changes.
The pourpes of this project is to learn by myself programming and is also a hobby of mine.

As i now write i realise that is very important to document your work. I should start commenting my code as i develope it.
